CentrED# MapTo2DMesh is a set of scripts that is my starting point of rendering totally custom/unique maps created in CentrED# for 2D use in Godot.

I will post more updates here if/when they happen. I hope this is useful or interesting to someone. 

I think of it like an alternative to using Trenchbroom for map creation in Godot, but 2d instead of 3d.
